Tennis League Scheduler

This program has been used to schedule a Tennis League (Portland Woman's
Tennis). The league is comprised of roughly 100 teams and 16
Clubs. Substantial effort was made to make the scheduler flexible through the
use of numerous properties files. The flexibility the properties files
provide are tailored to the rules and situations specific to this league. I
would expect the effort to make the scheduler work with other leagues would
be substantial.

There are four required properties files:
    club.properties
    date.properties
    scheduler.properties
    team.properties

Each of these properties files are documented with comments that explain the
expected content of each file.

This application is written in Java. The 'TennisScheduler' directory is
actually a 'NetBeans project'. It is known to work with Java (1.7.0_79) and
NetBeans (1.7.0).

To run this program within NetBeans:
   Copy project directory 'TennisScheduler' to 'NetBeansProjects' directory
   Create the properties files from the example property files provided
   Copy properties files to top of 'TennisScheduler' directory and make any
       required changes
   Open the 'TennisScheduler' project
   Run Project from NetBeans

Each Club will have a list of teams it will be hosting and the division they
play in. Each team win play two games (Home/Away) against each team in it's
division. There is acutally two seasons: Fall & Spring.

The scheduler has a number of fixed constraints to be considered. Examples
would be:
    The number of courts that are available for each day at a club
    The days that courts are available each club
    Division matches can only be scheduled on a specific day
    The order that divisions are scheduled in
    Variable times for spring breaks (no games schedule if either the school
        district is out for spring break)
    A team can specify blackout dates when the are not available for play
These (and more) can be specified in the property files.

There are also some 'dynamic' contraints the scheduler must support:
    Weighting is used to spread a teams scheduled matches. This will minimized
        the changes that a team will play two (or more) weeks in a row.

As a result of limited court availablity and a large number of constraints it
is possible that all matches cannot be scheduled. When this happens, the
unscheduled matches are listed so they can be manually scheduled. There is some
randomness so running it multiple will different results.
